### Task-1
Your first task is to create a simple AWS Lambda function that echoes a string argument it receives during invocation. During invocation, the function should also return the IP address of the server on which the Lambda service is running. Your Lambda function should also print the received string argument and the IP address (this printed log will of course be available to view on AWS Cloud Logs).

**Deliverables:** You need to include the following in your submission report...
1. The AWS Lambda function you created.
2. The AWS CLI command or AWS SDK code that you used to do the function invocation.
3. Two screenshots showing the function invocation and its result both on your client machine as well as on the AWS Cloud Logs.
